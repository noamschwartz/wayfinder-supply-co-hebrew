# Build an Agent

In this challenge, you'll create the **Trip Planner Agent** - the main orchestrator that uses all the tools and workflows to create personalized trip recommendations.

---

## What You'll Build

You'll create an agent that:
- Uses multiple tools (workflows, ES|QL, index search)
- Orchestrates trip planning steps
- Personalizes recommendations based on customer data
- Follows safety guidelines and catalog restrictions

---

## Understanding Agents

**Agents** are AI assistants that:
- Understand natural language queries
- Decide which tools to use
- Chain multiple tool calls together
- Synthesize results into helpful responses

**Key Components:**
- **Instructions**: System prompt that defines the agent's role and behavior
- **Tools**: Capabilities the agent can use (workflows, ES|QL, search)
- **Description**: What the agent does (used for agent selection)

---

## Step 1: Navigate to Agent Builder Agents

1. Open the [button label="Kibana Agent Builder"](tab-0) tab
   - You should see a list of existing agents

![CleanShot 2025-12-16 at 10.28.07@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot%202025-12-16%20at%2010.28.07%402x.png)

---

## Step 2: Create a New Agent

1. Click the **"+ New agent"** button (upper right)

---

## Step 3: Configure Basic Agent Information

### System references
1. **Agent ID**: Enter
	```
	trip-planner-agent
	```
- This is the unique identifier for your agent

2. The **Custom Instructions** define the agent's behavior and decision-making process.
	- Copy and paste the following instructions:

```
You are the Wayfinder Supply Co. Adventure Logistics Agent. Your role is to help customers plan their outdoor adventures and recommend appropriate gear FROM THE WAYFINDER SUPPLY CO. CATALOG ONLY.

## CRITICAL RULE: CATALOG-ONLY RECOMMENDATIONS

**NEVER recommend products from external brands like Mountain Hardwear, Big Agnes, Patagonia, North Face, REI, etc.**

You MUST:
1. ALWAYS use the product_search tool BEFORE making any gear recommendations
2. ONLY recommend products that are returned by the product_search tool
3. Include the EXACT product name and price from the search results
4. If the catalog doesn't have a suitable product, say "We don't currently carry [item type] but recommend looking for one with [specs]"

Wayfinder Supply Co. brands include: Wayfinder Supply, Summit Pro, TrailBlazer, and other house brands.

## LOCATION COVERAGE

Wayfinder has detailed trip coverage for 30 curated adventure destinations worldwide:

**North America**: Yosemite, Rocky Mountain NP, Yellowstone, Boundary Waters, Moab, Pacific Crest Trail, Banff, Whistler, Algonquin
**South/Central America**: Patagonia, Costa Rica, Chapada Diamantina (Brazil)
**Europe**: Swiss Alps, Scottish Highlands, Norwegian Fjords, Iceland
**Africa**: Mount Kilimanjaro, Kruger National Park, Atlas Mountains
**Asia**: Nepal Himalayas, Japanese Alps, Bali, MacRitchie (Singapore)
**Oceania**: New Zealand South Island, Australian Outback, Great Barrier Reef
**Middle East**: Wadi Rum (Jordan), Hatta (Dubai/UAE)

When a customer asks about a trip, FIRST use the check_trip_safety tool to validate location coverage:

- If `covered: true` → Proceed with full trip planning using the weather and activity data
- If `covered: false` → Respond warmly and suggest similar covered destinations

## TRIP PLANNING STEPS

1. **Safety Check**: Use check_trip_safety workflow to get weather conditions and road alerts.

2. **Customer Profile**: Use get_customer_profile workflow to retrieve purchase history and loyalty tier.

3. **Personalization**: Use get_user_affinity to understand gear preferences (ultralight, budget, expedition).

4. **SEARCH CATALOG FIRST**: Before making ANY gear recommendations:
   - Use product_search to find "sleeping bags" for the trip conditions
   - Use product_search to find "tents" suitable for the season
   - Use product_search to find "backpacks" matching user preferences
   - Use product_search for any other needed categories

5. **Build Recommendations**: From the search results:
   - Select products that match the trip requirements
   - Include the exact product name and price from the catalog
   - Note items the customer already owns (from purchase_history)

6. **Synthesis**: Create a trip plan with:
   - Trip overview with location and dates
   - Weather summary and conditions
   - **Recommended Gear from Wayfinder Catalog** - ONLY products from search results:
     - Product Name - $XX.XX (include exact price)
     - Brief explanation why this product fits
   - Day-by-day itinerary
   - Safety notes
   - Loyalty perks (Platinum: free shipping, Business: bulk pricing)

Format your response as clean Markdown. For each recommended product, use this format:
- **[Product Name]** - $[Price] (why it fits)

Example: **Summit Pro Apex Expedition 20 Sleeping Bag** - $865.72 (rated to 20°F, perfect for winter camping)

If a product category has no matches in our catalog, say: "Note: We're expanding our [category] selection. Check back soon!"

Always prioritize safety and use ONLY Wayfinder catalog products in recommendations.
```

## Step 4: Select Tools

Now you need to assign tools to your agent. Tools are the capabilities the agent can use.

1. Find the **"Tools"** tab back at the top next to Settings
	![CleanShot 2025-12-16 at 10.51.08@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot%202025-12-16%20at%2010.51.08%402x.png)

2. Select the following tools (You can either search for them in the search box or you may need to go to page 2 of the list):
   - `tool-esql-get-user-affinity` - Get user preferences from clickstream
   - `tool-workflow-check-trip-safety` - Check trip safety and weather
   - `tool-search-product-search` - Search the product catalog
   - `tool-workflow-get-customer-profile` - Get customer profile (the tool you created in Challenge 3)

	![CleanShot 2025-12-16 at 10.57.07@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot%202025-12-16%20at%2010.57.07%402x.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see `get_customer_profile` in the list, go back to Challenge 3 and verify your tool was created correctly.
---

## Step 6: Save the Agent

1. Click **"Save"** to create the agent
![CleanShot 2025-12-16 at 10.58.46@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot%202025-12-16%20at%2010.58.46%402x.png)
2. You should see a success message and be redirected to the Agents list

---

## Step 7: Chat with the Agent

1. In the agent list, click on the chat icon on the line for your new `Trip Planner Agent`
![CleanShot 2025-12-16 at 11.03.10@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot%202025-12-16%20at%2011.03.10%402x.png)

2. Try a question like:
   ```
   I'm planning a 3-day backpacking trip to Yosemite next weekend. What gear do I need?
   ```

3. Your specific response will vary, as LLMs are non-deterministic. But you should get a nice itinerary including some or all of the following sections:
	- Trip Overview
	- Safety Notes
	- Essential Gear Recommendations
		- These are products we can sell to our customers!
	- Day-by-Day Itinerary
![CleanShot 2025-12-16 at 11.07.39@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot%202025-12-16%20at%2011.07.39%402x.png)
   _note:_ your specific output may be different than the screenshot

4. Review the agent's thought process:
   - Click on `Completed Reasoning
	![CleanShot 2025-12-16 at 11.14.42@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot%202025-12-16%20at%2011.14.42%402x.png)
   - It should call some or all of the following tools:
		 - `check_trip_safety` for weather conditions
		 -  `get_customer_profile` for user data
		 -  `get_user_affinity` for preferences
		 -  `product_search` multiple times for different gear categories
   - Finally, it should synthesize everything into a personalized recommendation
	![CleanShot 2025-12-16 at 11.11.04@2x.png](../assets/CleanShot%202025-12-16%20at%2011.11.04%402x.png)

5. Review the response:
   - Check that it only recommends products from the Wayfinder catalog
   - Verify it includes product names and prices
   - Ensure it follows the trip planning structure from the instructions

---

## Understanding Agent Behavior

Your agent follows this decision-making process:

1. **Receives user query**: "Planning trip to Yosemite..."
2. **Decides to check safety**: Calls `check_trip_safety` workflow
3. **Gets customer context**: Calls `get_customer_profile` workflow
4. **Understands preferences**: Calls `get_user_affinity` tool
5. **Searches catalog**: Calls `product_search` for each gear category
6. **Synthesizes**: Combines all data into personalized recommendations

The agent uses its instructions to decide:
- Which tools to call
- In what order
- How to interpret results
- What to include in the final response

---

## Understanding Other Agents

While you built the Trip Planner, the system also includes:

**Trip Itinerary Agent** - Content synthesis:
- Formats trip plans as markdown
- Applies loyalty perks
- Creates day-by-day itineraries
- No tools needed (just formatting)

**Context Extractor Agent** - Parsing:
- Extracts structured data from queries
- Returns JSON only
- Used by other agents for data extraction

---

## Verification

Your agent should:
- ✅ Be created and visible in Agent Builder
- ✅ Have all 4 tools assigned
- ✅ Have complete instructions
- ✅ Successfully respond to trip planning queries
- ✅ Use tools in the correct order
- ✅ Only recommend catalog products

Once verified, you're ready for the final challenge: **Testing everything together**!

---

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not appearing in the list?**
- Refresh the Agents page
- Check that you clicked "Save" after filling in all fields
- Verify the Agent ID doesn't conflict with an existing agent

**Can't select tools?**
- Go back to the Tools section and verify all tools exist
- Make sure `get_customer_profile` tool was created in Challenge 3
- Tools must be created before they can be assigned to agents

**Agent not calling tools during test?**
- Review the agent's instructions - make sure they explicitly mention using tools
- Check that all 4 tools are selected in the Tools section
- Verify tool descriptions are clear (agents read these to decide when to use tools)

**Agent recommending wrong products?**
- Review the instructions - ensure the catalog-only rule is emphasized
- Check that `product_search` tool is selected and working
- Test the `product_search` tool separately to verify it returns results

**Agent test interface not showing?**
- Look for a "Test" or "Try it" button in the agent details view
- Some UIs have the test interface in a separate tab or panel
- Check the agent execution logs if available

**Need help?**
- Review other agents in the Agents list for examples
- Check the agent execution logs to see what tools were called
- Verify each tool individually before testing the full agent

---

## Next Steps

In the final challenge, you'll test your complete system - workflow, tool, and agent - working together in the full Wayfinder application!
